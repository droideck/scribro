1212 Rust is a modern, systems programming language that focuses on performance, safety, and concurrency, and it is often used for system-level and web programming. Its safety features include memory safety without garbage collection, thus preventing common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing and data races. Rust has a rich type system and offers great control over system resources, but it also enforces strict borrowing and lifetime rules to ensure safety. The Rust ecosystem is supported by a strong package manager, Cargo, and a vast repository of libraries, Crates.io.
